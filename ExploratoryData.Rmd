# Train Data
```{r}
train_raw <- read_csv("train.csv")
```

What is the study period?
```{r}
range(train_raw$Date)
train_raw %>%
  pull(Date) %>%
  range() %>%
  diff()
```
WNV Detection Trend
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
train_raw %>%
  group_by(Date) %>%
  summarise(WNV_in_year = sum(WnvPresent)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = WNV_in_year)) +
  geom_point()
```

Is the WNVPresent mosquito associated with day of week? 
```{r}
obs <- train_raw %>%
  mutate(dow = wday(Date, label = TRUE))
obs %>%
  group_by(dow) %>%
  summarize(sum(WnvPresent),
            median(WnvPresent),
            quantile(WnvPresent, 0.25),
            quantile(WnvPresent, 0.75))
  
```
